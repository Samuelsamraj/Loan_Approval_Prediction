# Loan Approval Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict the approval status of loans using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various features such as income, education, assets, and more, which are used to train models for predicting loan approval outcomes.

## Data Preprocessing

In this section, we performed data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, creating new features like Movable_assets and Immovable_assets, and encoding categorical variables. The dataset was also split into training and testing sets.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to understand the distribution of data and relationships between variables. Visualizations were created to explore factors such as the number of dependents, education level, income, and assets in relation to loan approval.

## Model Building

Two machine learning models, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier, were implemented to predict loan approval status. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to enhance model performance.

## Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC score. Confusion matrices were visualized to assess the true positive and true negative values.

## Feature Importance

The importance of features in predicting loan approval was analyzed using Decision Tree and Random Forest models. CIBIL score, number of dependents, assets, and loan amount were identified as significant factors.

## Conclusion

From the analysis, we concluded that CIBIL score, number of dependents, assets, and loan amount are crucial factors influencing loan approval. The Decision Tree Classifier yielded better results compared to the Random Forest Classifier.
